<h1>Panel 2</h1>



<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>At its simplest, <b>Panel</b> is a Matlab utility that simplifies the layout of multi-axis figures, for which you might otherwise use <tt>subplot()</tt>. An example layout is shown in the illustration (click to enlarge).</p>



<h2>Resources</h2>

<ul>
<li>These HTML pages provide a brief introduction to <b>Panel</b>. This page gives an overview of features, <a href="layout.html">Layout</a> covers how axes are organised within a figure, and <a href="export.html">Export</a> briefly describes exporting to image files.</li>
<li>The more complete User Guide for Panel comprises a collection of demo scripts; use <tt>help panel/demo</tt> at the prompt to see a list of the demos, and then use <tt>edit demopanel1</tt> to get started.</li>
<li>Detailed reference information is available through Matlab's documentation system (<tt>doc panel</tt>) or at the prompt (<tt>help panel</tt>).</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are new to Panel, start with <tt>demopanel1</tt>, and work your way through until you grow bored. If you want to know how to do something in particular, try <tt>help panel/demo</tt> and look through the headings.</p>



<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>

<li>Simple control over layout, for rapid development of complex nested layouts - see example top right, thirty seconds work (see demopanel1).</li>
<li>Easy rearrangement of layout, as opposed to sometimes tricksy <tt>subplot</tt> renumbering operation.</li>
<li>Figure-wide control of rendering (font size, face, etc.).</li>
<li>Work in physical units (millimetres, inches, etc.) or relative sizes, where appropriate.</li>
<li>An important feature is WYSIWYG rendering to image files. Coupled with the easy control over layout, this allows the generation of camera-ready artwork direct from Matlab.</li>
<li>Labelling/Titling of subplot groups, rather than individual subplots.</li>
<li>Interation with other graphics objects (e.g. uipanels), not just axes.</li>

</ul>



<h2>Changes since Panel 1</h2>

Upgrading users of Panel 1 will notice the following changes.

<ul>
<li>Moved to a <tt>classdef</tt> single-file implementation. The modern world, eh...</li>
<li>Neater, but different, interface, mainly as a result of the above change.</li>
<li>In Panel 1 you told Panel how to achieve the layout you want (rootmargin, axismargin, parentmargin). In Panel 2, you tell Panel what to aim for (one margin setting only, per axis) and it figures out for itself how to do it.</li>
<li>Support for being a child and parent of other graphics objects (rather than just Figures and Axes).</li>
<li>Miscellaneous feature additions (support for resize callbacks, layout reveal information, axis group labelling/titling, and some slight improvements to the export facility).</li>
<li>Integrated various suggestions from Matlab Central users.</li>
<li>One feature has not yet been integrated into Panel 2 - that's engineering scales. This will probably turn up in a later version; it's not a core part of Panel in any case. Let me know if you miss it.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Gotchas</h2>

<ul>
<li>Matlab's <tt>hold()</tt> function messes up panel's control over font properties. If you are having trouble, use panel's <tt>hold()</tt> function instead, which works in just the same way (see <tt>doc panel</tt>). Or you can just call <tt>refresh()</tt> when you're done messing around with your panels.</li>
<li>Panel solves a Linear Programming (LP) problem to maximise use of space. If you have the Mathworks Optimisation Toolbox installed, <tt>linprog()</tt> is used, which is very fast. If you do not, Panel uses its own internal solver, which is not optimised for large problems and so it can be noticeably slow for complex layouts. If you are having trouble with this, let me know and I will prioritise incorporating an optimised solver.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>Several Matlab Central users have made helpful suggestions which have led to Panel being improved. These are Arthur Ward, Niko, LP Pakula, Ian, Daniel, Mukhtar Ullah and Brendan Sullivan. The incorporated LP solver is due to Jeff Stuart, formerly of USM. Export to SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) requires <tt>plot2svg()</tt> by Juerg Schwizer (this does not ship with Panel, but is free to download <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/7401-scalable-vector-graphics-svg-export-of-figures">here</a>).</p>
